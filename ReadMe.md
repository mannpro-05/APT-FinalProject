- The pose-output.csv file is located in the source directory. This file contains the tensor for the pose estimation
  algorithm. This tensor will be used to create a visualization of the given exercises in the CSV file.

# Execution of the program.

- I have used jFree chart in my assignment-3. So, make sure that you have jFree chart dependency installed/added in your
  IDE. I will include the jar file in the zip file.
- Also make sure that for lucene you have lucene-core-8.2.0.jar and lucene-queryparser-8.2.0.jar installed.
- So you just have to run the file give some time for execution and 6 charts will be there on the screen.
- They will overlap each other so, you will have to drag them and place them around your screen to see the results.
- I will also be attaching a screenshot of the charts in the read me file.

# Note

- The search results for the wearable keyword will be empty as there is no keyword wearable in the first 1000 lines of
  the dataset.
